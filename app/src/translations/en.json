    "example": "The debt ratio is calculated by multiplying the sum of the borrowers yearly salary by { debtRatioMultiplyer }. Imagine you have two borrowers: Jonas and Emelie. Jonas earns { sallaryJonas } kr a month before tax and Emelie earns { sallaryEmelie } kr a month before tax. The debt ratio is therefore: (12 * { sallaryJonas } kr + 12 * { sallaryEmelie } kr) * { debtRatioMultiplyer } = ({ sallaryJonasYear } kr + { sallaryEmelieYear } kr) * { debtRatioMultiplyer } = { debtRatio } kr.

Then you have to pay { mortgageDeedPercent }% of { loan } kr - { mortgageDeed } kr = { mortgageDeedPercent } % of { mortgageDeedRequired } kr = { mortgageDeedToPay } kr. A fee of { mortgageDeedFee } kr is taken by Lantmäteriet to buy new mortgage deeds. Each bank takes an additional fee on top of that. Handelsbanken takes { bankFee } kr, for example.
