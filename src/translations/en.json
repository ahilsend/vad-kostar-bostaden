    "example": "The debt ratio is calculated by multiplying the sum of the lenders yearly salary by 4,5. Imagine you have two lenders: Jonas and Emelie. Jonas earns { sallaryJonas } kr a month before tax and Emelie earns { sallaryEmelie } kr a month before tax. The debt ratio is therefore: (12 * { sallaryJonas } kr + 12 * { sallaryEmelie } kr) * { debtRatioMultiplyer } = ({ sallaryJonasYear } kr + { sallaryEmelieYear } kr) * { debtRatioMultiplyer } = { debtRatio } kr. If the loan exceeds { debtRatio } kr you need to amortize an additional 1%.",
