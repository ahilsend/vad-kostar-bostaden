          Let us now look at your estate. Please enter the price and the existing mortgage deed (pantbrev). When you buy a new house you need to pay tax on the amount you loan.

          Each house has a mortgage deed (pantbrev) from the previous owner. You have to pay this fee to your bank as a form of insurance. It is calculated based on the prevous existing mortgage deed.
          It is calculated by substracting the existing mortgage deeds from the loan you have to take loan. You have to pay 2% of that amount.
          Imagine you want to buy a house worth 5000000kr. You pay the minimum down payment of 750000kr. That results in a loan of 4250000kr.
          The existing mortgage deeds cover 1200000kr. Then you have to pay 2% of 4250000kr - 1200000kr = 2 % of 3050000kr = 61000kr.
          A fee of 375 kr is taken by Lantm√§teriet to buy new mortgage deeds. Each bank takes an additional fee on top of that. Handelsbanken takes 1500 kr, for example. This fee varies by bank. Therefor it is not included in the calculation.
